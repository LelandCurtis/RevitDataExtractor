# RevitDataExtractor

C# Revit plugin package that extracts data from a Revit model and exports to a csv file to be used by outside applications. 

This project was part of an effort to explore how best to extract data from Revit and serve it up to users in non-Revit formats. The custom plugins are the first step in a larger process diagrammed below.
